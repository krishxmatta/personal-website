Hi, I'm Krish Matta.

I am an undergraduate student majoring in computer science with a concentration in machine learning and a minor in mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. This summer, I'm interning at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) on the Machine Learning Feature Store team. I have previously worked for/collaborated with: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2022), University of Delaware Safro Research Group (2021 - 2023), and Roblox (2023).

Academically, I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, philosophy, literature, and history. Casually, I enjoy strategy games (particularly card games), nature, horror movies, and many types of music (ambient, hip-hop, indie rock, jazz).
