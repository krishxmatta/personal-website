Hi, I'm Krish Matta.

# Work
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer science with a concentration in machine learning and a minor in mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. This summer, I'm interning at [Databricks](https://www.databricks.com/) on the Machine Learning Feature Store team. I have previously worked for or collaborated with: [NASA Goddard Space Flight Center](https://www.nasa.gov/goddard/) (2022), [University of Delaware Safro Research Group](https://safroresearch.blogspot.com/) (2021 - 2023), and [Roblox](https://www.roblox.com/) (2023).

# Interests
Academically, I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, philosophy, literature, and history. Casually, I enjoy strategy games (particularly card games), reading, nature, horror movies, and many types of music (ambient, hip-hop, indie rock, jazz).
