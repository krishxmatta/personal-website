## 12. Karna {#12-dot-karna}

The Pandavas and Kauravas are holding a performance displaying their practice of arms. Arjuna gives an excellent performance, and Duryodhana is envious. At the end of the day, Karna arrives to the performance. He duplicates Arjuna's performance effortlessly, causing Arjuna to challenge him to fight. Duryodhana is, of course, on Karna's side, cheering him on. As they prepare to fight, Karna's adoptive father Adhiratha enters and embraces him. Bhima begins laughing, realizing that Karna is the son of a charioteer. Duryodhana takes Karna in his chariot and they drive away.

Indra, Arjuna's father, foresees a battle between Arjuna and Karna. He dresses as a brahmana and asks Karna for his earrings and armor; Karna, in his generous manner, obliges. Indra, then in generosity, lets Karna ask for any weapon he wants. Karna wishes for Indra's weapon, the Sakti. Indra grants this, with the condition that he can only use it against one enemy, and once that person dies, the weapon will be returned to Indra.

Karna then goes to Parasurama to train under him. To be accepted, he pretends to be a brahmana. He learns how to use the weapon known as Brahmastra. One day, a worm burrows into Karna's thigh, causing much pain. He is able to hide the pain, however, so that he does not wake up Parasurma. Parasurma sees the blood and realizes that Karna is a kshatriya, not a brahmana, as only a kshatriya can withstand such pain. He curses Karna, stating that the Brahmastra will fail him at the moment he needs it most.


## 13. Drona {#13-dot-drona}

Drona is the son of a brahmana named Bharadwaja. He mentors Drupada, the son of the king of Panchala. In his youth, Drupada told Drona that once he became king, he would give Drona half his kingdom. Drona marries and has a son---he realizes that he needs wealth, and meets with Parasurama who is distributing his wealth before retiring to the forest. Parasurama is already out of money, so instead he offers Drona training of weapons. Drona agrees.

In the same time, Drupada becomes king. Drona meets with him, expecting to be treated generously. Drupada is extremely scornful towards him, claiming that they cannot be friends as they are not equals. Drona leaves the palace, vowing to punish Drupada.

One day, the Pandava princes are playing outside when their ball as well as Yudhishthira's ring falls into a well. Drona approaches them, and agrees to get both the ball and ring out. In an amazing act, he forms a chain using blades of grass to fish the ball out and uses a bow and arrow to get the ring out. In this amazing display, the princes bring him back to Bhishma. Bhihsma recognizes Drona, and sees him as a suitable mentor for the princes. The Pandavas and Kauravas train under him. Once trained, Drona sends Karna and Duryodhana to seize Drupada alive. They fail, so he then sends Arjuna who suceeds.

Drona then tells Drupada that, in revenge, he will be seizing half of his kingdom so that they are now equals. Drupada begins to hate Drona, performing several tapas and fasts to pray to the gods for a son who will slay Drona and a daughter who will marry Arjuna. This happens with the birth of Dhrishtadyumma, who commanded the Pandava army and slew Drona, and Draupadi, the wife of the Pandavas.


## 14. The Wax Palace {#14-dot-the-wax-palace}

Duryodhana's jealousy of the Pandavas grew as rumors began to spread that Yudhishthira would become king. He consulted with his father, Dhritarashtra, and made known his complaints. Initially, Dhritarashtra said that they cannot oppose the Pandavas, since they were so well liked that if they were to, the people would rise in an insurrection. Duryodhana convinced him that this is not true, and proposed the idea of sending the Pandavas to Varanavata. He was then able to convince some politicians to join his side, and they told him to guard himself from the Pandavas. Duryodhana once again tells Dhritasrashtra to send the Pandavas to Varanavata, and he obliges. He sends them off by telling them that there is a festival they should see. At Varanavata, Duryodhana sends off Purochana, a minister, to carry out a set of instructions to kill the Pandavas. He builds a palace of flammable materials for the Pandavas to sleep in. At night, he plans to set the palace on fire.


## 15. The Escape of the Pandavas {#15-dot-the-escape-of-the-pandavas}

The Pandavas set forth for Varanavata. Vidura tells Yudhishthira that he should be cautious. Keeping this advice in mind, at the palace, Yudhishthira realizes that the palace is built entirely out of flammable materials. He tells his brothers, and they decide to not tell Purochana that they know of his plot; instead, they plan to escape. A miner sent by Vidura builds for the Pandvas an escape tunnel into the forest. The brothers then wait. After one year, Purochana decides that it is time. The palace is set on fire, and the Pandavas alongside their mother leave through the hole. The entire palace is burnt down, alongside Purochana's own residence ironically. The citizens yell that this is Duryodhana's work. They tell the people in Hastinapura that no one is left alive. Dhritarashtra and his sons cast off in mourning, believing that their plan worked. Meanwhile in the forest, the Pandavas make their way to the city of Ekachakra, guised as brahmanas.


## 16. The Slaying of Bakasura {#16-dot-the-slaying-of-bakasura}

In Ekachakra, the Pandavas lived in the house of a brahman. They begged for food in the streets, then gave it to their mother, who rationed it into two halves: one for Bhima, one for everyone else. One day, Kunti heard loud lamentations from the house of their brahmana landlord. She heard that they had been discussing which one of their family members would be sacrificed. She went  to the house and inquired, finding that the city had been ruled by a Rakshasa named Bakasura who demanded sacrifices from each of the houses, and it was their turn. Kunti offered Bhima to go, knowing that he would be able to slay Bakasura. And so he did.


## 17. Draupadi's Swayamvaram {#17-dot-draupadi-s-swayamvaram}

While the Pandavas were living in Ekachakra, news of the swayamvaram of Draupati reached them. The sons wanted to win her over, and Kunti agrees to go to Drupada's kingdom. The Pandavas, under the guise of Brahmanas, attended the swayamvaram. Draupati's brother, Dhristadyumna creates a challenge for Draupati's future husband to pass: string a great silver bow and shoot five arrows at a target. The person who is successful in doing so, and is of proper family, will marry Draupati. The only person able to do so is Arjuna, who is disguised as a brahman. The other princes are angry, as they believe him to only be a brahman (and not Arjuna). Arjuna and Bhima escort Draupati back, and Dhristadyumna suspects them to be the Pandavas, so he tells his father Drupada. Drupada invites the Pandavas and Kunti to the palace, in which they admit that they are the Pandavas. They also tell Drupada that they must all marry Draupati, since they share everything. Drupada grudgingly obliges.


## 18. Indraparastha {#18-dot-indraparastha}

With the Pandavas revealed to be alive, Duryodhana's jealousy doubles. He tells his father, Dhritarashtra, that they must destroy the Pandavas, and soon. He comes up with several strategies to destroy them, but Karna believes that all of them will fail. In Karna's eyes, it is impossible to deceive them; as such, he instead recommends attacking them head-on. Dhritarashtra decides to consult with Bhima, Drona, and Vidura, all of whom recommend invited the Pandavas and giving them half of the kingdom. Dhritarashtra agrees with this and does so, granting Yudhishthira the title of king, to the dismay of Duryodhana and Karna. The Pandavas go to Khandavaprastha, rebuild the ancient city, and make it their capital, naming it Indraparastha. They live for thirty-six years here with their mother and Draupadi.


## 19. The Saranga Birds {#19-dot-the-saranga-birds}

In the Puranas, animals can speak, for they typically are reincarnations of previously living humans. When the Pandavas reach Khandavaprastha, they find a thick forest filled with thieves and wicked men. Thus, Krishna and Arjuna decided to set fire to the forest and build a city in its place. A saranga bird named Jarita was sitting in the forest with her four children as this occurred, while their father Mandapala was away with another female bird Lapita. The mother was desperately worried for her children as they could not fly; they convinced her to leave them so she could save herself, which she did. She came back to find them miraculously alive. Mandapala also came to see his children, to which Jarita did not like. She told him to leave them and go be happy with Lapita.

## Quotes {#quotes}

"No virtuous man is strong enough to live in virtue at all times, nor is any sinner bad enough to exist in one welter of sin. Life is a tangled web and there is no one in the world who has not done both good and evil." - Vyasa

"But learning is one thing and virtue is quite another. It is true that one should know the difference between good and evil, if one is to seek good and shun evil. But this knowledge should soak into every thought and influence every act in one's life. Then indeed knowledge becomes virtue. The knowledge that is merely so much undigested information crammed into the mind, cannot instill virtue. It is just an outward show like our clothes and is no real part of us." - Lomasa
