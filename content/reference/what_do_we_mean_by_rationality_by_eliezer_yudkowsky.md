Rationality refers to two things:

1.  Epistemic rationality: systematically improving the accuracy of your own beliefs.
2.  Instrumental rationality: systematically achieving your values.

Epistemic rationality is straightforward---it is about building an accurate view of the world.

Instrumental rationality is instead about steering reality, i.e. taking actions to lead to outcomes that you prefer.

When people say that something is rational, oftentimes they mean that it is true or good. So why do we need the concept of rationality, if it can be used as a synonym? The reason is the same as why we need the concept of truth: so we can note general facts about methods which systematically produce truth or value. For example, instead of saying that "It is true that snow is white," one could simply say "snow is white." But the usefulness of truth is so that we can make statements like "True models usually produce better experimental predictions than false models." We are using truth to generalize all such models. Similarly, we can say something like "rational agents aim to maximize their utility."

To decide whether a judgement is wrong or not, experimental psychologists rely on two standards: probability theory and decision theory.

Proability theory is the foundation to rational belief. It describes mathematically how to process evidence and use that to update beliefs. Decision theory, on the other hand, is the foundation to rational action.

Beliefs which conform to a coherent probability distribution and decisions which maximize the expectation of a coherent utility function are called Bayesian. For example, let \\( A \\) be the event that Billy plays jazz and \\( B \\) be the event that Billy is an accountant. If someone were to believe that \\( P(A) < P(A, B) \\), then this belief would be non-Bayesian, as probability theory states that \\( P(A) \geq P(A, B) \\). Note that this isn't the common notion of rationality in pop-culture, which is instead to "act like Spock," for example.

Probability theory and decision theory don't explain the entirety of rationality, however. First, it is impossible to do actually do the math. Instead, we have to instead rely on these as founding principles. Second, the meaning of the math itself is occasionally called into question. In these cases, we return to simpler ideas such as always seeking the truth and taking actions with lead to outcomes we prefer. You should not ignore something simply because you cannot define it.

We don't actually care about the word rationality itself---instead, we care about what is a good way to think.
