## Introduction {#introduction}

This book is meant to introduce how to think about the big themes of knowledge, reason, truth, mind, freedom, destiny, identity, God, goodness, justice, and so on. Philosophy carries connotations like impractical and unworldly, when in reality it is a study on engineering concepts. After finishing this book, it is recommended that the readers picks up some classic philosophy books.


### What Are We to Think About? {#what-are-we-to-think-about}

Consider questions which do not have a simple method of solution. For example, can we be sure that other people exist? There is no easy experimental method to answer this question. Questions that can be experimentally answered are called _empirical_ questions.

Self-reflection is what gives rise to non-empirical questions. As humans, we are capable of reflecting on ourselves, and on the concepts and beliefs that we normally just use, similar in idea to [The Lens That Sees Its Flaws by Eliezer Yudkowsky]({{< relref "the_lens_that_sees_its_flaws_by_eliezer_yudkowsky.md" >}}).

Reflection isn't a rare occurrence, either. For example, a historian may naturally ask when a source can be considered as the objective truth or not. This is a reflection on the truthness of something. At this point, the historian becomes a philosopher.

How can the thinking skills required to answer, or at the very least, explore these questions be learned? It is similar to playing the piano, i.e. knowing how to do rather than knowing something.

In summary, our ideas and concepts are the lens through which we see the world; in philosophy, we study and question this lens. Success is not a measure of how much you know, but how you can reason about things.


### What is the Point? {#what-is-the-point}

A natural question to ask is, what is the point of pondering these reflective questions? They don't get business done.

We sketch three answers: a high ground, a middle ground, and a low ground.

The high ground questions the actual question: what is the point to most of the things we do? Art, literature, history, etc. don't get business done either. We simply do it because we want to understand, in the same way a physicist wants to understand the universe. Things in life can be done for the sake of wanting them. Doing such tasks is good for our mental health, which is just as important as our physical health. The issue with this response is that it appeals to those who are already half convinced.

The middle ground states that reflection is important because it affects your practice. How you think about what you are doing affects how you do it. For example, if you believe in the after-life, you may be concerned with living a sin-free life. Another example is how people think of mind and body. Many think that the mind and body are two completely separate entities, but if a doctor thinks this way, then they will be unable to treat physical conditions that arise from psychological causes.

The low ground answer polishes up the middle ground statement. Our ideas are why we take actions. Our ideas form our opinion on others, who we are, and what our interests are. Reflection enables us to see if our perspective is distorted, or whether our opinions have evidence behind them.


## Chapter One Knowledge {#chapter-one-knowledge}

An unsettling thought that many of us have in childhood is, is the world a simulation, or is it real? Eventually, we shake these suspicions off, but with no evidence to do so. What is the relationship between appearance and reality?


### Losing the World {#losing-the-world}

We begin with discussing Descartes, a French mathematican and philosopher who, on November 10 1619, had a dream which inspired his philosophical writings. In these writings, he argues that God exists, and that the human soul and body are distinct entities. Note that Descartes was a pious Catholic during a time of great scientific achievement (e.g. helio-centric model), and thus the context behind these writing were to make scientific writings safe for human beings, i.e. reflect on the foundations of knowledge. His works are known as the _Meditations_, published in 1641.


### The Evil Demon {#the-evil-demon}

There are six _Meditations_. In the first one, he introduces the method of doubt. In order to establish the truth of anything within the sciences, he must rid of all his original opinions and derive everything from the foundations. He claims that even his senses have decieved him before, and that he never completely trusts something that has deceived him even once.

A possible counterexample to this idea that we cannot trust our senses is that only madmen do not trust their senses. In response, Descartes uses the idea of dreams; dreams are an example in which our senses tell us of something that is not reality. Thus, he is not a madman for thinking that the senses are unreliable. He does qualify this with the idea that dreams are still rearrangements of reality, however, implying that what our senses perceive as reality may still have some semblance to true reality; what is true, however, he does not know, and thus doubts everything.

He proposes the idea of an Evil Demon whose goal is to delude him through his senses. To guard himself, he tries to not believe any falsehoods. He notes that this is hard to do in normal life, but intellectually he must work through these problems he has raised.


### Cogito, Ergo Sum {#cogito-ergo-sum}

In the second _Meditation_ Descartes becomes overwhelmed by these doubts. He wonders if his senses and his body don't exist. But, he reasons that he himself exists; if he can think, then he must exist. It's not possible for him to think without existing. Thus, the famous "Cogito, ergo sum": "I think, therefore I am."

He then asks himself what his self is. He can no longer think that his body is real, and he cannot imagine his real body since he has no idea whether it actually exists or not.

Instead, the basis of the knowledge of the self is thought. He can only define himself as a thing that thinks.

Such a thought is difficult to grapple with; how can we imagine the self if it has no definitive corporeal embodiment? This leads him to consider physical bodies that most think they understand. For example, take a ball of wax. He can taste it, smell it, see that it has a color, shape, and size, and it makes a sound when he taps it. But if he takes this ball of wax and melts it, all of these things change. _But in his mind, he still knows that it is the same wax, i.e the wax remains._ All of the senses he could identify with the ball of wax have disappeared, yet he knows the wax remains. Thus, physical bodies are not perceived by the intellect alone, and this isn't derived from the senses itself, but just how the body is understood. From this fact, he knows that he can understand his mind with utmost clarity.


### Motivations, Questions {#motivations-questions}

We see some motivation for Descartes's meditations: extreme doubt (also known as Cartesian doubt). But, is this doubt enough to motivate? He succintly describes his motivation as: "The senses sometimes deceive us. So for all we know, they always deceive us." But, this is a logical fallacy. The starting premise is true, but the conclusion does not follow. One can give a simple counter-example: Some banknotes are forgeries, so for all we know, they are all forgeries. But it is impossible for a forgery to exist without some real version of the object to exist.

An argument is considered _valid_ if there is no way for the premises to be true without the conclusion being true, i.e. the conclusion follows from the premises.

An argument is considered _sound_ if it is valid and it has true premises, meaning that the conclusion must be true as well.

The argument identified with Descartes is invalid, but we can give him the benefit of the doubt that he had something else in mind which he did not explicitly identify; this is called a _surpressed premise_. We can also reinterpret him as aiming at a weaker conclusion: The senses sometimes deceive us. We cannot distinguish occasions when they do from ones when they do not. So for all we know, any particular sense experience may be deceiving us.

This is much more likely to be valid; we cannot use the same counterexamples, since the conclusion is about any particular experience rather than all experiences.

Perhaps the weaker conclusion is all Descartes needs to investigate. We can also think about the second premise of this argument: we cannot distinguish occasions when our senses deceive us from when they do not. Is this premise true? We must introduce a qualifier. It may be true that we cannot detect errors and illusions _at a glance_, but is it true that we cannot do this _at a given time_? It seems that we can do so. But this fact that we can detect deceptions is required by Descartes's own argument, since his first premise, the senses sometimes deceive us, can only be presented as true to others if we can detect such tricks. So, the second premise seems to be only true if it were understood as "we cannot distinguish at a glance whether our senses are deceiving us." But to justify Descartes' doubts, we would need "we cannot distinguish even over time and with care whether our senses are deceiving us," which does not seem true.

Descartes then introduces the topic of dreams, which seems to make sense of this. Inside of a dream, we have experiences which resemble real life, but there is nothing real in the dream. Is his idea that life itself is like a dream?

It is difficult to object to this. There is no reliable method to tell whether we are in a dream or not. We may try to argue that dreams are spasmodic whereas life is coherent. But the idea of the Evil Demon refutes this, for the Evil Demon can make life as grand or coherent as he wishes.

Descartes acknowledges that we should not bother with such outlandish possibilities in the world outside of study. But, it is still worth inquiring about this during study, as it provides us with a foundation to determine whether our beliefs are true or not. The inquiry is made for only intellectual reasons, a hypothetical; he is not bothered with convincing us of the possibility of an Evil Demon, only asking us to consider it to find a way to dismiss it and confirm our beliefs. Unless the possibility of the Evil demon can be dismissed, then there is still skepticism.

The thought experiment is not too far from reality. A nice reframing: imagine a world in which scientists are now able to take your brain, place it in a vat, and simulate each of the senses with chemicals, creating a sort of virtual reality. You would not be able to tell whether you were in this vat or not, since it seems as if normal life were just continuing.

Of course, Descartes's version of the thought experiment does not discuss brains and vats but instead the Evil Demon. And if you think about it, the idea of brains and vats is senseless in the context of an Evil Demon, since our notion of brains and their role in generating consciousness are grounded in the reality that we live in; brains may not exist in the actual reality where the Evil Demon lives. So to create our virtual experience, the Evil Demon may only need to input whatever experience he wants through the proper method in his reality.

Once again, we can not argue against the Evil Demon by citing the coherency of reality vs. dreams, since for all we know, the Evil Demon can input experiences with whatever coherency he wants.

It is extremely difficult to rule out the Evil Demon hypothesis. The axiom which Descartes anchors himself to is "Cogito, ergo sum"; I think, therefore I am. Even if I am in a virtual reality, I am the one who is experiencing it. The Demon's project is to deceive me about everything. But he cannot deceive me if I do not exist. He cannot make me think I exist when I do not, since I must exist to do the thinking. Thus, I must exist.


### The Elusive "I" {#the-elusive-i}

Outside of Descartes's skepticism, when we say "I," we are referring to a person that can be described in various ways: for example, I am a student in computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. But when we start doubting, all of this is useless, as it is in the context of our virtual reality. Now, "I" only refers to the subject of thought itself, no body can be ascribed to it (once again, as it is part of the virtual reality).

Then, how can you describe yourself without the context of virtual reality? This is difficult to do. We can not imagine what our true self looks like, as imagination only works for embodied things, but we are not necessarily an embodied thing, reason being that we are certain of ourselves when we are not certain that embodied things exist. Descartes is stating that the soul is distinct from the body as we are certain of the soul but uncertain of the body. Many see this as a fallacy, called the masked man fallacy, as a similar line of reasoning yields: I know who my father is, I do not know who the masked man is, therefore the masked man is not my father. It is doubtful that Descartes commits this fallacy since his only goal is to explore the way in which we know anything about souls and bodies, not to prove that they are different.

Later, German philsopher Georg Christoph Lichtenberg claimed that we should say "it thinks" in the same way we say "it thunders" rather than "I think," as he believes that the existence of a subject of thought "I" is an illusion itself; Descartes is not entitled to an "I" that is thinking, **he can only know that a thought is occurring.**

This is seemingly bizarre, for how can thoughts exist without one to think it? But upon some thought, Lichtenberg's thought does seem motivated: if Descartes can not imagine or characterize this "I," how can he guarantee that it exists?

Putting this issue aside, Descartes raises another difficulty about things that people think they understand best, things which exist in space. Returning again to the ball of wax, we see that even after every sensory aspect of the wax changes, we still understand that the wax is the same, implying that understanding is what is used to reason, not senses.

Descartes is not denying that senses are what tell us that the wax is there in the first place, but instead suggests that the senses are messengers that deliver information which need interpreting. Understanding is what accomplishes this interpretation.

So, we understand that the wax is some thing that can we understand to be the same despite taking on different properties. **In the same way, the self, or the "I," is some thing that we can understand to be the same despite taking on different thoughts.** In other words, the self is no harder to understand than physical bodies, like a ball of wax.


### Clear and Distinct Ideas {#clear-and-distinct-ideas}

The first two meditations are classics of philosophy, as they show imagination and rigor to an extent that has rarely been seen. At the end of these, Descartes is left standing on cogito, with no materials he can use to build himself out, particularly since even natural means of reasoning are not protected against the Evil Demon. There is nothing to say that the Evil Demon isn't deceiving us into using false reasoning. From here, Descartes reflects on why the cogito is so certain. It is because he has such a "clear and distinct" perception of its truth, in the same way that a mathematician is convinced of a theorem by its proof. One philosophical ideal is that we can understand the rest of the world using such reasoning; this is rationalism, the idea that we can use primarily reasoning to create knowledge about our world. Knowledge created through this process of rational insight is known as "a priori," as it can be seen as true without any prior knowledge of the world, independent of experience.


### The Trademark Argument {#the-trademark-argument}

While reflecting on his own self, Descartes finds that he has an idea of perfection. He argues that having this idea implies some cause, and this cause must be in reality. Thus, a perfect cause, which is God, exists in reality, and he is why we have an idea of perfection.

With God existing, we can soothe our doubts about the world; since God is perfect, eh does not deceive. Our senses do not fail us, and the world is as perceived.

Here is a neater reconstruction of the argument: "I have the idea of a perfect being. This idea must have a cause. A cause must be at least as perfect as its effect. So something at least as perfect as my idea caused it. Therefore such a thing exists. But that thing must be perfect, that is, God."

This is a deeply flawed argument. First: why do ideas must have a cause? In the context of the Evil Demon, we do not know that this is true. For all we know, he may be deceiving us that ideas have a cause. Second, even worse: it doesn't seem logical that a cause must be at least as perfect as its effect. For example, I can think of what a perfectly punctual person looks like, without ever meeting a perfectly punctual person. I can define a perfectly punctual person without one ever existing.

Thus, this "trademark" argument is not valid, in the context of the Evil Demon or not. But, there may be surpressed premises to excuse this argument. For one, he inherited the idea that genuine causation is the cause passing on something to an effect. For example, the transfer of heat is required to make something hot. Thus, in passing on something, it must exist in the first place. Thereby justifying the idea that a cause is at least as perfect as its effect, since it must transfer its "perfectness" to that effect. But this is certainly not true in the general case: movement of a piece of iron through a magnetic field has no inherent electric current, yet it causes one.


### The Cartesian Circle {#the-cartesian-circle}

At this point, by its "clear and distinctness," Descartes believes that he has God, who is known to not be a deceiver by his perfectness. But, he has disregarded the idea that "clear and distinct" ideas may still be false by virtue of the Demon.

To combat this, Descartes turns to God, the one whose existence he has just proven, as evidence that what we believe to be clear and distinct as true. One of his contemporaries, Antoine Arnauld, recognized that Descartes was arguing in a circle, now known as the "Cartesian circle."

To make this circle explicit, denote \\( CD \implies T \\) as the conditional "if something is clear and distinct, then it is true," and \\( G \\) as "God exists and does not deceive us." Then, Descartes uses \\( CD \implies T \\) to argue \\( G \\), but then he argues \\( G \\) to show \\( CD \implies T \\). Thus, he establishes \\( (CD \implies T) \iff G \\), but he does not actually show that either is true.

Some defend this by stating that Descartes does not actually need to show that \\( G \implies (CD \implies T) \\). He can be certain that God exists without being sure about the rule \\( CD \implies T \\), in the same way that we can be sure about something without being sure of the principles that we must cite in order to defend them. For example, I can be sure that a sentence is grammatical without knowing the explicit grammatical rules.

Philosophers are very difficult on this possibility; for example, the character Socrates in Plato's _Dialogues_ gets people to say one opinion, then shows them that they can't defen this opinion by citing general principles. But this is not really valid, since, for example, I can recognize that something is in front of me using my eyes without citing the physics of optics and perception.

We can still ask why Descartes things that he can be certain of this instance of the rule \\( CD \implies T \\) when showing \\( G \\). We leave this issue, noting that there is certainly a double standard: he completely removes any mention of the Demon in an effort to expand upon cogito, meaning that perhaps there is no true way off cogito.


### Foundations and Webs {#foundations-and-webs}

Scottish philosopher David Hume (1711-1776) criticized Descartes. He first summarizes his position, stating that Descartes promotes us to doubt everything, even our own senses (universal doubt), then to derive everything via a chain of reasoning originating from some original principle, i.e. an axiom. He is not convinced that such an axiom exists, and even if it does, that we could not use any reasoning to advance past it. Thus, Cartesian doubt is unattainable and we can never be fully sure on any subject.

Thus, what should we make of Descartes' works? General skepticism? Or something else entirely?

Hume agrees that a system of beliefs needs to have some sort of foundation to be built on. But, he does not believe that this foundation can be completely rationally verified. **Instead, he accepts the truthfulness of the senses as part of his foundation, and that it cannot be shown via reasoning alone.** Many British philosophers agreed in this line that pure reason alone is insufficient, and such philosophers are labeled as empiricists while Descartes is labeled as a rationalist. Of course, however, philosophers' opinions are more nuanced than labels can express.

The issue with Descartes was that he relied too much on reasoning alone. Instead, we can appeal to nature (our natural tendency to form beliefs and correct them).

The true moral story of the Evil Demon is not to distrust everything, but rather to understand that if we wish to reason about our world, we must take the "leap of faith" and trust our senses. This is what Descartes refers to as "God." Hume believes that we do not need to ask this question in normal life. Thus, hyperbolic doubt is not real.

You may think of this as sensible, or you may think of this as being complacent. But to quell worries of complacency, it's important to realize that what this is not saying is to throw out doubt between how things are in reality and how things appear to be. Instead, approach them within our normal framework of beliefs. Hume himself, approaching it this way, still found the need to reintroduce skepticism. In other words, we can still be skeptic between reality and what we perceive without having to be overly skeptic.

Another sign of optimism is that evolution, which is responsible for our senses and reasoning ability, would not have selected for them if they did not work. If they did not inform of us of reality, then how could we have survived? **The harmony between our minds and our the world is due to the fact that the world is responsible for our minds.** This does not do away with the Evil Demon, but it instead implies that we can trust our senses _in the context of the world as we know it._

A different perspective dissolves any need of foundations. It notes the difference between the coherent structure of our "real" experience as opposed to our sporadi dreams, realizing that coherent structures do not need foundations. For example, a web is simply made up of interconnecting parts, with its strength coming only from those connections. _There is no foundation; some bits support other bits without there being one bit supporting everything._ Austrian philosopher Otto Neurath (1882-1945) used this metaphor for our body of knowledge: "We are like sailors who on the open sea must reconstruct their ship but are never able to start afresh from the bottom." Any one part can be replaced, assuming that there is enough of the rest on which to stand. This approach is called "coherentism," and I find this paragraph really interesting, but I do note that it seems to rely on analogs to physical systems rather than logic... and moreover, physical systems are derived from "one fundamental principle," that here being gravity in a sense.

Thus, there are four options in epistemology, the theory of knowledge: rational foundationalism (Descartes), natural foundationalism (Hume), coherentism, and skepticism (there is no knowledge).
