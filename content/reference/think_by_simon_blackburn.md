## Introduction {#introduction}

This book is meant to introduce how to think about the big themes of knowledge, reason, truth, mind, freedom, destiny, identity, God, goodness, justice, and so on. Philosophy carries connotations like impractical and unworldly, when in reality it is a study on engineering concepts. After finishing this book, it is recommended that the readers picks up some classic philosophy books.


### What Are We to Think About? {#what-are-we-to-think-about}

Consider questions which do not have a simple method of solution. For example, can we be sure that other people exist? There is no easy experimental method to answer this question. Questions that can be experimentally answered are called _empirical_ questions.

Self-reflection is what gives rise to non-empirical questions. As humans, we are capable of reflecting on ourselves, and on the concepts and beliefs that we normally just use, similar in idea to [The Lens That Sees Its Flaws by Eliezer Yudkowsky]({{< relref "the_lens_that_sees_its_flaws_by_eliezer_yudkowsky.md" >}}).

Reflection isn't a rare occurrence, either. For example, a historian may naturally ask when a source can be considered as the objective truth or not. This is a reflection on the truthness of something. At this point, the historian becomes a philosopher.

How can the thinking skills required to answer, or at the very least, explore these questions be learned? It is similar to playing the piano, i.e. knowing how to do rather than knowing something.

In summary, our ideas and concepts are the lens through which we see the world; in philosophy, we study and question this lens. Success is not a measure of how much you know, but how you can reason about things.


### What is the Point? {#what-is-the-point}

A natural question to ask is, what is the point of pondering these reflective questions? They don't get business done.

We sketch three answers: a high ground, a middle ground, and a low ground.

The high ground questions the actual question: what is the point to most of the things we do? Art, literature, history, etc. don't get business done either. We simply do it because we want to understand, in the same way a physicist wants to understand the universe. Things in life can be done for the sake of wanting them. Doing such tasks is good for our mental health, which is just as important as our physical health. The issue with this response is that it appeals to those who are already half convinced.

The middle ground states that reflection is important because it affects your practice. How you think about what you are doing affects how you do it. For example, if you believe in the after-life, you may be concerned with living a sin-free life.
