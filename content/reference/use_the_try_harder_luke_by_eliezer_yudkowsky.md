In Star Wars, there's a scene in which Luke Skywalker attempts to lift his spaceship, an X-wing, out of a swamp as Yoda watches. He tries, the ship rises, and then it sinks. He promptly gives up.

During the filming of this scene, a discussion between George Lucas, the director, and Mark Hamill, Luke's actor, arises. Mark argues that Luke should at least try some more before giving up. George disagrees. George concludes that the audience would find giving up immediately believable, since it is in human nature to not even try for five minutes before giving up, even if the fate of humanity was at stake.
