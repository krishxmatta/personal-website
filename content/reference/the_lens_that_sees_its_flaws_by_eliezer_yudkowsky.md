Light leaves the Sun, bounces off an object; photons enter your puils, strike your retina, triggering neural impulses which are then transmitted to the portion of your brain which processes visual information. This information is processed to create an internal 3D model of the object.

Deliberate rationality is the idea that we can understand things, such as the process of seeing described above. It is not magic. For example, mice can see, but they can not understand how they can see. We can. A mouse's mental world does not include its own brain, but ours does include our own brain.

Science is reasoning about a reliable process to make our beliefs align with the reality. Science makes sense. It exists because we can reason about our own thinking.

Sometimes, we allow our opinions on beliefs to incorrectly muddle our view of the world: beliefs which make us happy are more likely to be true, and beliefs which make us unhappy are less likely to be true. But our opinions on beliefs does not provide us evidence about our environment, and hence can not be used to distort our view of reality.

Thankfully, we can think about our brains. We can recognize this flaw, and apply corrections, thereby making our reasoning ability significantly more powerful. **A human brain is a lens that sees its own flaws.**
