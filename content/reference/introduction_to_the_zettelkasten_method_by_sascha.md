## Luhmann's Zettelkasten {#luhmann-s-zettelkasten}

Luhmann was a highly prolific social scientist who achieved so much via his Zettelkasten.

His Zettelkasten was a collection of notes on paper slips, with a structure that allowed him to navigate his entire cabinet in a reasonable amount of time. Note that compared to digital methods, achieving such a structure is quite difficult physically. He created his note collection such that it was navigable, with entry points to begin reading from.


### Why Are We So Interested In Luhmann's Zettelkasten? {#why-are-we-so-interested-in-luhmann-s-zettelkasten}

Based on Luhmann's success, his Zettelkasten is inspiring. Additionally, it provides improvement to general note-taking methods:

1.  Improving the connectivity of thoughts, via its hyper-textual nature.
2.  More productive by providing clear guidelines on how to handle different scenarios.
3.  Stops wasting efforts by improving how much you are processing from a topic.
4.  Enables you to tackle more complex problems by concentrating on only small parts of the problem.
5.  Avoid the bloated mess as a result of normal note-taking via organic growth.
6.  Makes your writing easier and more coherent.


### The Fixed Address of Each Note {#the-fixed-address-of-each-note}

To be able to refere to a note, it needs to have a fixed (and unique) address. Luhmann's approach was to grant the first note 1. If you had a note which did not relate to 1, you would then give 2, etc. If you had a note which related to 1, you would instead label it 1a. Something related to 1 but not 1a would be given 1b. Something related to 1a would be given 1a1. And so on.

In essence, if you are continuing a train of thought, you increment. If you are elaborating/refining, append a new character.

In the digital age, this is not necessary due to surfable hypertext.

To enter his notes, i.e. where to start, Luhmann used a register to start. This is not to be confused for a tagging system. Luhmann would place the IDs of very few items in his register---it should only list the biggest and most important clusters of notes.


## A Zettlkasten Is a Personal Tool for Thinking and Writing {#a-zettlkasten-is-a-personal-tool-for-thinking-and-writing}

Luhmann's Zettelkasten is organic and non-linear. It has three important traits:

1.  It's hyper-textual.
2.  It adheres to the Principle of Atomicity.
3.  It is personal.

First, it is a hypertext, i.e. texts which refer to one another. **Zettelkastens emphasize forming relationships and connections between notes.** Connecting is the priority; not collecting. An individual note is called a Zettel. Zettels are the building blocks of a Zettelkasten.

To form connections between Zettels, each Zettel needs a unique identifier.

Second, a Zettelkasten must adhere to the Principle of Atomicity. Each Zettel only contains one unit of knowledge, i.e. one thought.

Third, there is one Zettelkasten per person, and one person per Zettelkasten. Zettelkastens should have the capability of being private, since writing for yourself is different than writing to the public.


## The Anatomy of a Zettel {#the-anatomy-of-a-zettel}

Each Zettel consists of three components:

1.  A unique identifier.
2.  The body of the Zettel, i.e. the actual knowledge.
3.  References, reference the source of knowledge or leave it blank if you are capturing your own thoughts.


### The Unique Identifier {#the-unique-identifier}

The unique ID is mandatory to create a Zettel so that it can be referenced. The actual ID methodology does not matter much, only do what works in your system.


### The Body of the Zettel {#the-body-of-the-zettel}

The body of the Zettel contains the piece of knowledge you wish to capture. **It's important that you write it in your own words.** This improves recall.

On how selective you should be when making a Zettel, you should only write Zettels for knowledge, not information. Information just is, while knowledge adds.

Links to other notes should be littered throughout your note.


### Reference {#reference}

The end of your Zettelkasten is a reference to the source of the knowledge, if it exists.


## Connecting Zettel {#connecting-zettel}

The power of the Zettelkasten comes from connecting notes. Connecting will allow you to train yourself to see useful patterns.

When making a connection, **you should always state explicitly why you are linking them.** This is called the link context. Adding links without contexts does not create knowledge. In the future, you need to be confident that following a link will provide meaningful information.


## Structure Notes {#structure-notes}

Hierarchal structure is useful. In his register, not every relevant Zettel was listed, only the most central Zettels. He also had hub notes, which are Zettels which list many other places to look for a topic.

Structure notes are meta-notes, meaning that it is about other Zettels and their relationships. For example, it can be a list of other Zettels on a topic.

By adding structure, it's easier to get a bigger picture of one's knowledge.
