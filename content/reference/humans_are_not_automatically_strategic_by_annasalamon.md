This work is a reply to [A "Failure to Evaluate Return-on-Time" Fallacy](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/RzdPXLd2b6qmEB2mf/a-failure-to-evaluate-return-on-time-fallacy). In it, lionhearted states that a majority of otherwise smart people spend their time doing semiproductive tasks while there are many untapped productive opportunities.

Calculus tests are easy to fail, as most answers that one could write down are incorrect. People typically choose ineffective routes to pursuing their goals for the same reason: most courses of action are ineffective. No strong force pushes us to focus on the very specific behavior patterns which lead to success.

There are a few ways in which we have goals. We (1) tell ourselves and others of how we're aiming for various goals, (2) figure out behaviors that our consistent with achieving these goals, and (3) feel glad or disappointed when we do or don't achieve our goals.

There are, however, heuristics that would be useful to goal-achievement which we do not automatically do. For example, we do not automatically:

-   Ask ourselves what we're trying to achieve.
-   Ask ourselves how we can tell when we've achieved it, and how we can track progress.
-   Find ourselves curious about information that would help us achieve our goal.
-   Gather this information.
-   Test different conjectures for how to achieve the goals, tracking which do and don't work.
-   Focus the energy not in systematic exploration into methods which work best.
-   Ensure that our goal is really our goal in the sense that it is worth doing.
-   Use environmental cues and social contexts to increase our motivation in the face of frusturation.

Instead of these, we mostly just do things. We rely on habit and impulse. We do any action that feels related to our goal. **We do not systematically choose the narrow sets of actions which optimize for our goals.**

The reason for this is that humans are only on the cusp of general intelligence. Only a small portion of the population can verbally understand the above heuristics, let alone automatically implement them.
