## Introduction {#introduction}

Language models are systems that assign probabilities to sequences of text. When given initial text, they use the probabilities to generate new text.

Extended large language models are models which add to the ability of a language model. For example, the ability to the process both image and text inputs.

The question is: are current large language models conscious? Could future large language models be conscious? What challenges must be overcome to have conscious machine learning systems?

First we talk about what consciousness is. Then, we discuss reasons in favor of consciousness in current large language models. We then discuss reasons for why large language models are not conscious. Finally, we discuss some conclusions and a roadmap to large language model consciousness.
