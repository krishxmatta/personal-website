As described in the [Introduction to the Zettelkasten Method by Sascha]({{< relref "../reference/introduction_to_the_zettelkasten_method_by_sascha.md" >}}), Zettelkasten structure notes are notes that are only about other notes and their relationships. Most of my structure notes are a list of notes related to a given topic. An example of a structure note is: [Books]({{< relref "books.md" >}}).
