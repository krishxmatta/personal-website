After eating dinner, my sister and I decided to drive to the Bellevue Botanical Gardens and walk there. It was my first time visiting, but I've heard many things online about it being a great place to walk in Bellevue. We didn't explore the entire garden thoroughly due to time, but from what we saw the garden was quite large and very pretty. Overall, a great place to walk and take pictures.
