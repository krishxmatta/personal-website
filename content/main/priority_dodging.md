I often find myself subject to a trap in which I _use work to procrastinate from more important work_. For example, if I have an important upcoming interview, instead of actually preparing for that interview, I find some other task on my to-do list to complete instead, like reading ten pages from a book. I call this form of procrastination _priority dodging_, and it's much more dangerous than other forms of procrastination. When you play video games, for example, you make the conscious decision to not do something productive and maybe feel bad about it---but with priority dodging, _you feel rewarded for doing the wrong action_ since it feels like you're doing something productive, making it much more difficult to quit.
