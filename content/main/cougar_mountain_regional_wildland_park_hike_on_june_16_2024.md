Some of the other Databricks interns and I decided to hike in Cougar Mountain Regional Wildland Park. We began at the Red Town Trailhead, and mostly followed the [Wildside Trail to Shy Bear Trail to Cave Hole Trail](https://www.alltrails.com/explore/trail/us/washington/wildside-trail-to-shy-bear-trail-to-cave-hole-trail) route, with some detours. The first mile of the hike was somewhat difficult to some pretty quick elevation gain, but after that the hike was pretty easy. Overall, I found the hike to be okay, with my main issue being that there weren't any scenic views along the trail.
