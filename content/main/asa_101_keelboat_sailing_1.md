ASA 101, Keelboat Sailing 1 is the American Sailing Association's (ASA) introductory class to sailing. I took this class over June 1-2, 2024 at the [Puget Sound Sailing Institute](https://www.pugetsoundsailing.com/) with instructor Michael Clidas in Tacoma, Washington.


## Preliminaries {#preliminaries}

Before the on-water portion of the course, you are required to: watch four video lectures as well as read the textbook _Sailing Made Easy_ by the American Sailing Association. The video lectures were created by the Puget Sound Sailing Institute, and thus are only required at the institution; the textbook was written by the American Sailing Association, and thus required for everyone taking ASA 101.

I began with the videos but found them dull. I thought that reading the book would be a much better use of my time, especially since my learning style is more oriented towards reading than listening. Thus, after watching two of the videos, I pivoted to the book and never touched the videos again.

Due to procrastination, I ended up reading most of the book the day before my first class. The book is a nice resource, but I didn't find it to be very welcoming to complete beginners. The authors of the book made the egregious decision to use terms before defining them, which was very confusing to someone like me who has never been on a sailboat before and didn't know the first thing about common terminology. Consequently, I often found myself flipping back to earlier pages once having a better understanding of certain terms. On this first pass-through, I didn't read the book with high scrutiny, instead aiming to get an idea of sailing rather than be bogged down in technical details. I had the intention of revisiting the book after completing the first day of on-water training so that I'd understand everything better while reading.


## On-Water Training {#on-water-training}

The on-water training portion of the course took place at [Tyee Marina](https://tyeemarina.com/) in Tacoma, Washington on a Colgate 26 named Slipstream. There were four students, including me, and one instructor. We rotated between different roles, taking the tiller, main sheet, or jib sheets, practicing tacking, gybing, man overboard, and docking drills. Our second day of on-water training had a decent amount of rain, making the sailing trip extremely cold. Nonetheless, this entire portion was extremely enjoyable and the reason why I (and probably everyone else) signed up for the course in the first place: to sail. Our instructor did a fantastic job of making everyone feel safe, welcome, and interested. I can't say that I'm confident in sailing without the help of someone else right now, but I do think that I could be a somewhat productive crew member.

Unfortunately, I was not able to take pictures or videos during this portion of the course as I had my phone stowed away the entire time to prevent it from damage.


## Written Test {#written-test}

After the on-water portion of the course, we had a 100 question written test. Getting an 80% or higher on this test was required by the ASA in order to receive the ASA 101 certification. It was entirely multiple choice. The night before coming into the test, I once again reviewed the textbook, paying particular attention to the review questions at the end of each chapter. These questions were invalubale to cementing my knowledge for the test. Additionally, my instructor had held great reviews during the on-water training that allowed me to get a 100% on the test. I think that the test was intentionally made easy by the ASA; the hardest part is to not make careless mistakes. If you read the textbook, you'll do fine.


## Overall Thoughts {#overall-thoughts}

I found this course to be a great introduction to sailing with some light theory and great practical knowledge. My instructor did a fantastic job, and I thank him for making it an enjoyable experience. I'd really love to do cruising with my family in the future, so my next sailing goals are to get some more on-water practice and to also complete ASA 103, the next course in the sequence.
