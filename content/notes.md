Notes consist of random thoughts I've decided to write down and publish. As such, spelling mistakes and uninformed opinions may be present. I've separated my notes into two pages:
- [Main Notes](/main/): Notes about original ideas that I've come up with.
- [Reference Notes](/reference/): Notes on the works of others.
