Hi, I'm Krish Matta.

* Work
I'm an undergraduate student majoring in computer science with a concentration in machine learning and a minor in mathematics at Carnegie Mellon University. I have worked for/collaborated with: NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (2022), University of Delaware Safro Research Group (2021 - 2023), and Roblox (2023).

* Interests
Academically, I'm interested in computer science, mathematics, philosophy, literature, and history. I'm a strong proponent of "T-shaped knowledge"---deep expertise in one subject paired with a broad understanding of other disciplines.

Casually, I enjoy strategy games (particularly card games), nature, horror movies, and many types of music (ambient, hip-hop, indie rock, jazz, shoegaze).
